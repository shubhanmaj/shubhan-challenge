# QA Take Home Challenge

Welcome to Morning Brew's QA Challenge ðŸ‘‹

## Details

This technical take home consists of 2 parts.

Both parts of the test are geared around this open-source project: https://github.com/reck1ess/next-realworld-example-app

- The live application can be viewed [here](https://next-realworld.vercel.app/)
- The api spec can be found [here](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/tree/main/api)

### Part 1 (Test Planning)

#### The following is a feature request from our product managers:

- Add the ability to delete users in the [Conduit](https://github.com/reck1ess/next-realworld-example-app) project.
- Only users with the "system admin" role are able to delete users.

#### Somewhere within this repository please write out the following in a text or markdown file:

- The **entry criteria** for the above feature request
- The **exit criteria** for the above feature request
- Which tests are the highest priority for automation? 

### Part 2 (Test Automation)

Please write the following automated tests using tooling of your choice ([Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is prefered):

- Test the signin flow
- Test the signup flow
- Write tests around 1 additional feature listed in the [functionality overview](https://github.com/reck1ess/next-realworld-example-app#functionality-overview) that you think is a high priority

## Timeframe

We're asking that you don't spend more than 6-8 hours on this task. Find a good stopping point and if you don't get everything done, consider just writing out what you would do next within this README.
I was able to finished the assignment by the scheduled time. Faced issues while pushing to repository.
Delete article functionality is failing due to locator or some element (wish could have spend little more time on it)
Read/Update Article should have covered
End of the execution mochaawesome/html report should be genrated

## Stuck

If you get stuck or have any follow up questions you can reach out to Drew at drew@morningbrew.com.

We generally ask though, that you give this your best shot based on your understanding of the task. We will talk about the task and your understanding when you are done.

## Finishing up

1) Please push all your code to this repo (or another repo that you've set up - but be sure to link it somehwere here).
3) Please respond to the email from our Talent Acquisition team member to indicate the project is complete and to schedule a follow up with our Engineering team.
